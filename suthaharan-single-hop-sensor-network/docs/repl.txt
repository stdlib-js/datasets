    Returns a dataset consisting of labeled wireless sensor network data set
    collected from a simple single-hop wireless sensor network deployment using
    TelosB motes.

    Humidity and temperature measurements were collected at 5 second intervals
    over a six hour period on May 9, 2010.

    Temperature is in degrees Celsius.

    Humidity is temperature corrected relative humidity, ranging from 0-100%.

    The label '0' denotes normal data, and the label '1' denotes an introduced
    event.

    If a mote was an indoor sensor, the corresponding indicator is '1'. If a
    mote was an outdoor sensor, the indoor indicator is '0'.

    Returns
