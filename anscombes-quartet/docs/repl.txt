    Returns Anscombe's quartet.

    Anscombe's quartet is a set of 4 datasets which all have nearly identical
    simple statistical properties but vary considerably when graphed. Anscombe
    created the datasets to demonstrate why graphical data exploration should
    precede statistical data analysis and to show the effect of outliers on
    statistical properties.
