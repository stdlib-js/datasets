    A few notes:

    - The list is an earlier version of AFINN-111.
    - The list includes misspelled words. Their presence is intentional, as such
      misspellings frequently occur in social media content.
    - All words are lowercase.
    - Some "words" are phrases; e.g., "cashing in", "cool stuff".
    - Words may contain apostrophes; e.g., "can't stand".
    - Words may contain dashes; e.g., "cover-up", "made-up".
